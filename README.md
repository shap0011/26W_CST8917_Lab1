## Local Function Project

### Create New Project

A local Azure Functions project with an HTTP-triggered function was created successfully using Python.

### Configure Project Settings

The project settings were configured according to the lab instructions, including the correct Python interpreter, runtime version, and authorization level.

The project structure includes all required configuration files such as `host.json`, `function_app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `local.settings.json`.

The HTTP-triggered function was executed locally and tested successfully using a query string parameter.

### Configure Local Storage

Local storage was configured using Azurite for local development.  
The `AzureWebJobsStorage` setting in `local.settings.json` was updated to use the development storage emulator.

This configuration allows the Azure Functions runtime to manage logging and triggers locally without requiring a real Azure Storage account.
