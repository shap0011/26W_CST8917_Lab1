## Local Function Project

A local Azure Functions project with an HTTP-triggered function was created successfully using Python.  
The project settings were configured according to the lab instructions, including the correct Python interpreter, runtime version, and authorization level.

The project structure includes all required configuration files such as `host.json`, `function_app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `local.settings.json`.

The HTTP-triggered function was executed locally and tested successfully using a query string parameter.
